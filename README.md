# RockPaperScissors-Solidity-Protocol
A series of Smart contracts implementing the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game on EVM compatible blockchains.

This project was embarked on as the solution to an optional assignment as specified [by this repo](https://github.com/slingshot-finance/RockPaperScissors-test-project/blob/main/README.md).

It's important to note that this project was - in my sincere opinion - rushed. I was preoccupied with the thought of submitting the application that had this as an optional assignment. I had no idea of the expiration date for entries so I worked frantically to spin up something that was at least practical.

However, the project in my opinion is modular and can be easily extended to implement other interesting features; some of which I’m already working on on a local branch.

This project consists mainly of Solidity (for the smart contracts) and Javascript (for the tests) source codes.

The project is fully tested using using the HardHat framework. The tests can accessed from the `test` directory.

As a final note, I intend working on a React.js frontend for the application which I’d commit here too.

Thank you.
